			<p>This project began as an experiment when I inexplicably decided to learn how an optical rotary encoder worked (FYI, 2-bit gray code).</p>
			<p>It transformed into a learning experience around USB - specifically the HID protocol. Ultimately I ended up with a simple gadget that now sits on my desk and allows me to control the PC volume.</p>
			<p>A salvaged optical encoder was used to detect rotation along with a reclaimed head drum from a VCR which was repurposed as a control knob.  I very much like the smotth bearings combined with the heavy mass that let the drum spin forever.</p>
			<p>Key concepts for the project were:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The optical encoder parts (sensors and disk) were salvaged from an old track-ball.</li>
				<li>The "knob" was made from the head drum of a VCR (remember those?).  This is the part that spins and is used to adjust volume on my PC.</li>
				<li>The optical disk was fixed to the shaft and optical sensors mounted off some strip-board and attached to the base of the drum.</li>
				<li>This assembly is mounted to a custom PCB with some nylon stand-offs. The PCB became the base of the whole unit.</li>
				<li>I cut some wooden rings to enclose the electronics and the base of the VCR drum.</li>
				<li>The custom PCB was designed in eagle and etched at home from some single-sided copper-clad board. The circuit was designed around an AVR at90usb162.</li>
				<li>The code is written in C and implements the LUFA library developed by Dean Cameron.</li>
				<li>The whole unit plugs into a PC via USB and is automatically identified as a HID - no drivers required (tested in Debian Linux and Windows).</li>
				<li>It's a very simple device - rotate clockwise to increase volume, counter-clockwise to decrease.</li>
        			<li>Code and PCB design are available via gitlab (<a href="https://gitlab.com/clewsy/volcon">link</a>). Here are some reference links:</li>
