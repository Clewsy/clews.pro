# clews.pro


I am slowly removing my dependency on cloud services (google in particular) by self-hosting open alternatives.


Herein lies the docker-compose.yml file with which I establish my personal web site and various web apps under sub-domains.

I use this file with docker-compose to set up the following containers:
* nginx-proxy - used to reverse-proxy the  domain and sub-domains.
* letsencrypt - used for https encryption of the domain and sub-domains.
* nextcloud-app - my personal nextcloud instance.
* mariadb-nextcloud - the database required by the nextcloud container.
* collabora-app - allows me to edit documents within my nextcloud instance.
* bitwarden-app - my personal password management server.
* nginx-clews.pro - clews.pro html and css.
